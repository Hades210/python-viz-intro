{"name":"Introduction to data visualization in Python","tagline":"Brief introduction to data visualization in Python, including plotting data from NetCDF files.","body":"## About this site\r\nThis site contains notes, source code and sample data for a set of short lessons that are designed to help the student get started with the basics of plotting and visualizing scientific data using Python. This material was originally created for a [NERC](http://www.nerc.ac.uk)-funded [Short Course in Data Assimilation and Visualization](http://www.reading.ac.uk/maths-and-stats/news/DA_Course.aspx) at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk) but is made freely available to the community (under a [BSD licence](LICENSE?raw=true)).\r\n\r\n## The course\r\nThe course consists of XX short lessons. Each lesson has a set of notes, plus sample scripts and (sometimes) data files. Here are the links to the lessons themselves:\r\n\r\n1. TODO: add links to lessons\r\n\r\nYou can download a zip file containing the lessons notes, source code and data files using the links above.\r\n\r\n## Software requirements\r\n(If you are taking part in the Short Course in Data Assimilation and Visualization all this software will be installed on the lab machines. You only need to know this if you are working outside the Reading computer labs.)\r\n\r\n1. A copy of Python version 2.7 (other versions may work too, with minor variations)\r\n1. The following libraries: [Numpy](http://numpy.org), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), [Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/), [Python-NetCDF4](https://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/).\r\n1. Optionally, [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook) to use the lesson notes in `.ipynb` format.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, a full installation of [Python(x,y)](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/) should provide all or most of the above.\r\n\r\n## Improving this course\r\nIf you have any suggestions for modifications to this course, please email Jon Blower at j.d.blower@reading.ac.uk or (even better) fork this repository, make the changes and submit a pull request.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
