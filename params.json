{"name":"Introduction to data visualization in Python","tagline":"Brief introduction to data visualization in Python, including plotting data from NetCDF files.","body":"This practical session will introduce you to some simple plotting and visualization tasks in the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language. No prior knowledge of Python is assumed. Each lesson consists of a web page that takes you through the main concepts, with code examples. The lessons are accompanied by sample scripts (with the extension `.py`). These scripts can be run to produce plots and visualizations - but sometimes key lines are omitted and you will have to fill these in to make the script work, using the knowlege you have gained from the notes. Hopefully you should be able to work out what code you need to write in these sections, even if you don't know Python well.\r\n\r\nBefore you start, you should download the sample scripts and data files as a zip file using the link above and extract to a directory of your choice. Don't worry if you don't finish all the lessons in the time available. This material will stay online for you to study in your own time if you wish.\r\n\r\n## The lessons\r\nWork through these in order. If you already know Python, you can skip the first lesson (or skim it briefly).\r\n\r\n1. TODO: add links to lessons\r\n\r\n## Software requirements\r\n(If you are taking part in the Short Course in Data Assimilation and Visualization all this software will be installed on the lab machines. You only need to know this if you are working outside the Reading computer labs.)\r\n\r\n1. A copy of Python version 2.7 (other versions may work too, with minor variations)\r\n1. The following libraries: [Numpy](http://numpy.org), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), [Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/), [Python-NetCDF4](https://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/).\r\n1. Optionally, [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook) to use the lesson notes in `.ipynb` format.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, a full installation of [Python(x,y)](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/) should provide all or most of the above.\r\n\r\n## About this site\r\nThis material was originally created for a [NERC](http://www.nerc.ac.uk)-funded [Short Course in Data Assimilation and Visualization](http://www.reading.ac.uk/maths-and-stats/news/DA_Course.aspx) at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk) but is made freely available to the community (under a [BSD licence](LICENSE?raw=true)).\r\n\r\n## Improving this course\r\nIf you have any suggestions for modifications to this course, please email Jon Blower at j.d.blower@reading.ac.uk or (even better) fork the Git repository (see \"View on GitHub\" above), make the changes and submit a pull request.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
