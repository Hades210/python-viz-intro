# Ideas for future lessons

Following the first delivery of this practical session on 17th Sept 2014, here are a few ideas for more lessons, or how we could improve in future:

## Ideas for improvement
1. We spent a little too much time wrestling with practicalities, e.g. changing directories at the Windows command prompt. Plus the SciTE text editor was on the students' machines but not the instructor's! Next time we could try running the whole thing from IPython Notebook or the Spyder environment, although these may take a little longer to set up.

## Possible future topics
1. Generating bivariate colour maps
  * e.g. to look at uncertainties together with the data
  * e.g. latitude-dependent colour scales
2. Generating spiral heat map plots (useful for long timeseries)
3. Function boxplots for looking at ensembles of timeseries (e.g. http://dx.doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2011.09224)
4. Use of bokeh library for interactive plots
5. Co-plot data from models and observations
