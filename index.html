        <section id="main_content">
          <p>This practical session will introduce you to some simple plotting and visualization tasks in the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> programming language. No prior knowledge of Python is assumed. Each lesson consists of a web page that takes you through the main concepts, with code examples. The lessons are accompanied by sample scripts (with the extension <code>.py</code>). These scripts can be run to produce plots and visualizations - but sometimes key lines are omitted and you will have to fill these in to make the script work, using the knowlege you have gained from the notes. Hopefully you should be able to work out what code you need to write in these sections, even if you don't know Python well.</p>

<p>Before you start, you should download the sample scripts and data files as a zip file using the link above and extract to a directory of your choice. Don't worry if you don't finish all the lessons in the time available. This material will stay online for you to study in your own time if you wish.</p>

<h2>
<a name="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>We assume you are familiar with the basics of programming: you should know what a loop and an "if" statement are, and the concept of breaking a program up into smaller chunks (e.g. subroutines or functions). We assume you know about basic data types (integers, floating-point numbers, strings and arrays). Knowledge of object-oriented programming is not needed, but some lessons use this style and familiarity with the syntax will be helpful.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the above, the "Further Reading" section of the first lesson contains some suggested resources.</p>

<h2>
<a name="the-lessons" class="anchor" href="#the-lessons"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The lessons</h2>

<p>Work through these in order. If you already know Python, you can skip the first lesson (or skim it briefly). The lessons (web pages) contain hyperlinks to external websites that contain more information; therefore it is best to read these notes in a web browser instead of on paper. Some lessons have exercises you can work through to test your knowledge. All lessons finish with a set of Further Reading that you might like to follow up with later.</p>

<a name="software-requirements" class="anchor" href="#software-requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software requirements</h2>

<p>(If you are taking part in the Short Course in Data Assimilation and Visualization all this software will be installed on the lab machines. You only need to know this if you are working outside the Reading computer labs.)</p>

<ol>
<li>A copy of Python version 2.7 (other versions may work too, with minor variations)</li>
<li>The following libraries: <a href="http://numpy.org">Numpy</a>, <a href="http://matplotlib.org">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap/">Basemap</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/">Python-NetCDF4</a>.</li>
<li>Optionally, <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook">IPython Notebook</a> to use the lesson notes in <code>.ipynb</code> format.</li>
</ol><p>On Windows, a full installation of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/">Python(x,y)</a> should provide all or most of the above.</p>
